# Step 2: Subscribe the HTTP/HTTPS endpoint to the Amazon SNS topic<a name="SendMessageToHttp.subscribe"></a>

To send messages to an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint through a topic, you must subscribe the endpoint to the Amazon SNS topic\. You specify the endpoint using its URL\. To subscribe to a topic, you can use the Amazon SNS console, the [sns\-subscribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/subscribe.html) command, or the [Subscribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Subscribe.html) API action\. Before you start, make sure you have the URL for the endpoint that you want to subscribe and that your endpoint is prepared to receive the confirmation and notification messages as described in Step 1\.
